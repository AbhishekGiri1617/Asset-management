        <p> <strong> Asset management</strong> is the process of organizing, planning and controlling the acquisition, use, care, refurbishment, and/or disposal of physical assets to optimize their service delivery potential and to minimize the relate disks and costs over their entire life through the use of intangible assets such acknowledge based decision making applications and business processes. <br> <strong> Asset Management System </strong>is simply a system that help any Institution keep track of all their assets such as library books to all the essential equipment’s and Investment. Keeping tabs on the assets helps streamline operations, especially in relation to their sale or disposals. The process also minimizes the chance of recording ghost asset since all the available assets are well accounted. <br> An effective asset management system improves the accuracy of record by using the asset management features. It also avoids spending on dublicate assets by accessing assest register and it stick to the budget by acurately tracking the request </p>

          Asset Management System will help the organization to track the usability and availability of assets in a cost-effective and organized manner <br>
          An effective management system also provides access to a comprehensive asset register for all educational personnel. This includes teachers, department heads, administrators, managers, and even local districts. The data highlighted in an asset register allows staff and students to know the location, condition, and quantity of each institute asset.

        An important part of keeping an educational institution running smoothly is making sure all critical assets are operating at maximum output. One way this can be achieved is with an effective maintenance and repair schedule. For instance, by checking the correct data stored in the system, schools will be able to know when the bus needs a service. As well as identifying when the computers in the IT department will be unavailable due to updates and repairs. <br>
          This project will start with the registration process of any organization and end by managing all the asset by using the record system and by properly purchasing the asset as per the request by vendors through Asset Management System

        <ul>
          <p>According to our research we found out that all the big organization needs someone like asset manager to look after their physical assets irrespective of there size and value.  This managing of assets is very lethargic work as all of these were managed by a person using registers, manually. They used to keep several registers for different types of assets for example one register for all the travelling vehicle the organization holds, one register for all the computer labs item, one for the mechanical items and so on and so forth, which was very, very, very difficult job to do. As if we were to update something about any asset than we would have to first search for that particular register, then search for the category of the item, then search the page number and so on.  So, this kind of asset managing was a job of a professional to do and was very tiring too. And we also found out that this professional had to go to all the assets to check there working conditioning manually. 
            <br><br> So, in its alternative we have thought of a new system where we will NOT need any professional to manage the asset of organization.  And also, it will reduce the amount of time that were utilized to manage these assets. Since it does not need any professional to operate it also becomes cost effective too. And will easier to operate so any one can do this job.
            <br><br> And some best benefits of our system are:-
            </p>
        
          <li>
            <strong> Improve the Accuracy of Record Keeping</strong>
            <p>The amount of paperwork required to track equipment, documents, and records throughout institute grounds can be overwhelming. But, the right school asset management tool can provide the features necessary to build a central data repository for all essential assets. This is also crucial for protecting and backing-up data in case of fire or damage, which can destroy a paper-based asset management system and lead to complications and delays when it comes to filing insurance claims.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Avoid Spending on Duplicate Assets</strong>
            <p>Having access to the institute’s asset register can reduce spending on equipment that is already available. For instance, a teacher may request that their classroom needs more chairs. But, by looking at the data, they’re able to see a number of chairs not being used in another department. Instead of purchasing more chairs, they can relocate them from one department to another, where they can be of more use.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Stick to Budgets by Accurately Tracking Spending</strong>
            <p>By using the right tools, institute are able to manage and track spending requests of each faculty department. This can be a request such as trays and cutlery from the school cafe, or for more books and desktops from library staff. Whatever the requirement, these requests need to be aligned with the budget set by the Department of Education or the local district</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Reduce the Amount of Manual Asset Audits</strong>
            <p>With access to a real-time asset register, staff are able to know the location and quantity of equipment available to them. This means the constant need for manual audits of assets, which require a lot of time and resources, are no longer needed.</p>
